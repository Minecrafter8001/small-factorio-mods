    "description": "This mod allows you to route belts and pipes automatically: \n  1. Put the starting belt and ending belt on ground first, \n  2. then select the starting belt with control+right-click and \n  3. select a ending belt with control+left-click.\n  Boom, belt ghosts are created!\n  (hint: you can also disable underground belt by shift+ctrl+left-click at the ending belt)"
