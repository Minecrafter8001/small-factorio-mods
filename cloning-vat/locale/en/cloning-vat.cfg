cloning-vat="Thermal Cloning Vat": An epitome of advanced replication technology. This apparatus allows for the duplication of most solid items and fluids. Feed it with the desired resource and, with the right amount of thermal energy, watch it produce a multiplied output. Be cautious: the higher the rarity of the resource, the more energy and time the process demands. Regular maintenance is required to keep the vat at optimal performance. Note: Certain rare resources resist the replication process. Suitable for debugging and developing mods with a long process.
