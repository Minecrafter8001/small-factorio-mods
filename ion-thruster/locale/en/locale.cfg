ion-thruster=Ion Thruster

[mod-description]
ion-thruster=Adds an additional Ion thruster. Brings futuristic technology to Factorio, generating efficient thrust through ionized gas acceleration, with customizable performance settings and fuel value calculations for your interstellar adventures!

[fluid-name]
xenon=Xenon
[fluid-description]
xenon=This is currently the most commonly used ion thruster fuel. Xenon has a high atomic mass and low chemical reactivity, which makes it ideal for use in ion thrusters. Its plateau quantum means that each ion carries more momentum, thus providing more thrust. In addition, xenon's low chemical reactivity means that it does not react with other substances, reducing corrosion and contamination inside the thruster.

thruster-ion-reactor=Thruster Ion Reactor
ion-thruster-xenon-generator=xenon generator

[technology-name]
ion-thruster=Ion Thruster

[technology-description]
ion-thruster=Unlocks the ability to accelerate ionized gas to generate thrust using electric fields.

[entity-description]
ion-thruster=Uses the power of ionized gas acceleration to generate efficient thrust with high specific impulse. Electricity is required.
thruster-ion-reactor=this reactor uses ionized gas instead of fluoroketone, resulting in the lack of electrodynamic properties necessary to generate electrical power.
